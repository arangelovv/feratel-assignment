System:
Filter section component
Design a filter section component that can be reused in order to "apply" filters on certain pages. The section represents groups of filter items in the form of inputs.
The filter uses a grid system to place different filter items next to each other until the "width" of the screen is filled and then the items break on separate lines.
In addition at the end of each line (always right aligned) there are two buttons - "Reset filter" and "Load Data". You can find a visual example in the zip file.
For the sake of simplicity use only input of type text.
